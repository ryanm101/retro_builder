# Game Boy

## Build

Uses [GBDK](https://github.com/Zal0/gbdk-2020) and gives some basic structure.
Includes & Libs stored in /opt/gbdk/include and /opt/gdbk/lib.

The example 'space' in the example dir comes from the GBDK examples dir, the only modifcation was to the Makefile to enable it to build with the docker image.
