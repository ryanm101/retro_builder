# Retro Builder

## Purpose

This project aims to create a central hub of tool chains and CICD tooling for the building of homebrew for retro hardware. So that developers can drop their code into a set structure and build without worring about the build process.

Toolchains:

- [ ] N64 
- [ ] 68K (Sega MD / Amiga)
- [ ] NES
- [ ] SNES
- [ ] Gameboy DMG
- [ ] Gameboy Advance
- [ ] PSX
- [ ] Dreamcast


## Build
All of the tool chains will be built as docker images as this provides a simple way of ensuring that all processes are kept in a consistant format. 

## Test
This is still to be determined as it requires the build process to somehow integrate with an emulator / real hardware and as most homebrew is likely to be games / UI based automated testing will have to be strech goal as opposed to a primary one. 

## Release
